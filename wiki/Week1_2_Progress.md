# Week 1–2 Progress Report  

**Dataset:** RGB-D Stair Dataset (Mendeley Data)  
**Goal:** Enable stair and step detection on mobile using computer vision.  

**Tasks Completed:**  
- Dataset loaded and verified (train, val, test).  
- Created smaller subset for Colab.  
- Implemented classical stair detection with OpenCV (Canny + Hough).  
- Began CNN pipeline setup.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Add labels for stair_up vs stair_down.  
- Train deep-learning classifier.  
- Begin Android app integration.
